So I hope that you've saved the source code from this class, you can see at "github.com/mikeckenendy/write-pythonic-code-demos", we have all the code you saw me write during all the videos, so please take this moment, go over there and star that repository, maybe fork it, maybe download it, or at least bookmark it in your browser so that you can come back to it, it should be here forever but you never know, right.
Also, I want to encourage you to play with these ideas, and if having the source code to start from helps you play with those ideas in your own code, in your own project, then please do so.
