Congratulations, you've made it to the end of the course.
You've completed over 50 examples contrasting non-Pythonic code with idiomatic Pythonic code.
I hope you've learned a ton, I hope you have a new appreciation for some of the idioms built into Python, why we use them, what their advantages are and how you can apply them to your apps.
The ones you've already built and the ones that you are going to build in the future.
