If this dive into "what is Pythonic code", what are the idioms and the best ways of working in Python is interesting to you, I encourage you to check on my podcast "Talk Python To Me"; on "Talk Python To Me", I interview many of the great developers in the Python community, and our conversations often get around to things that touch on or hint at Pythonic ideas.
We've talked about SQLAlchemy, and I've had Mike Bayer on the show who is the creator and maintainer of SQLALchemy, we talked about Python For Humans, all done by Kenneth Reitz, he was on the show talking about Requests and APIs and so on, and that just gives you a sense of how you can dig much deeper in these topics, so if this resonates with you, go check out the podcast.
And before you leave, I want to take the chance to say "thank you, thank you for having the faith in me to buy my class, thank you for taking the time and spend it with me to make it all the way to the end." I hope you fond it really valuable and I'd love to connect with you online or offline, thanks again.
