Next up, code layout.
Let's see what PEP 8 has to say about it.
The most important part about code layout that PEP 8 talks about is indentation.
So, imagine we have a method called some_method(), it says that you should indent four spaces, and PyCharm of course, as you've seen, knows PEP 8 and indents four spaces for us automatically, so: one, two, three, four, there we are.
And, we can write something so we could define a variable, hit Enter, like an "if" statement, so something like "if x is greater than two", enter; Python does not like us to use tabs, PEP 8 recommends we use spaces and every indent is four spaces, but it even looks like if I hit tab and delete tab and delete, hit tab, back and forth, it's actually four spaces and PyCharm just treats blocks of four spaces like tabs for us so that it's easier for us to work with.
Next, PEP 8 also talks about spaces between methods and other statements, so for example here it says there should be two blank lines between this method and anything else, somewhere down here two blank lines, two blank lines, I can go and fix this, but if I hit Command+Alt+L it will actually fix all of those spaces for us.
If we look within a method, PEP 8 says there should be either zero or one blank line between any section of that method, and use the blank line sparingly but to indicate a logical grouping; so you can see maybe we wanted to define x and later have this if statement, that would be fine, but if we go farther you can see "hey, PEP 8 warning, too many blank lines", put that back.
Last thing that I'll highlight is around classes, so if we have a class called AClass here, you can see it has three methods, and just like functions, it should have two blank lines separated in it from other module or level things like the top of the file, the method down here, and so on, but within the class, there should be one blank line between methods, not two.
So that's different than functions, when you are looking at methods within a class, it's a little more tightly grouped as you see here.
So let's look at that in a diagram, here we have our method, you can see the little dashes indicate spaces, which have all of our symbols within our method indented four spaces, additionally four more spaces for loops and conditionals and more and more as you nest those things, right, there should be two blank lines between methods, classes and other symbols defined within your module, and finally, PEP 8 recommends that you don't have lines longer than 79 characters, although there is a lot of debate around the value of exactly 79, but you know, it's a guidance, basically try to avoid having super long lines but don't do so by changing your code structures so much that it becomes small, so for example don't, like, create all your variables to just be one character so that when you combine them in some expression they still fit on the line, you would be better off using the continuation, but the idea of not having really long lines of code that's a good idea.
