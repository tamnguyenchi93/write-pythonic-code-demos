Python is often referred to as a programming language and ecosystem with batteries included, and on one level that means it has a really rich standard library.
Things like the JSON module that's built-in and so on.
It also means looking at the larger ecosystem all the 80 000 packages on PyPi, things like that, so in this section we are going to focus on the Python idioms around packages, modules, importing them, creating them, those kinds of things.
I want to give you just a little bit inspiration before we get to the technical details so if I come over here and run Python 3, and I go type in "import", I could say "import json" things like that, and then I could say "json.dumps" given a dictionary and so on, right, "json.dumps", here a is 1 and boom, we have JSON, but we could also import all sorts of things, we could go to PyPi install some packages and import them for example I could "import requests", because I've installed that somewhere, to capture this idea of how amazing packages are, we have this concept of "import antigravity", so what happens if I import antigravity? Well something pretty awesome, it pulls up this xkcd about why Python is awesome because you can import anything so here I'll just read it to you really quick, so we have this guy up here he is totally flying and his friend says, "Dude, how are you flying?" "Python, I just learned it last night everything is so simple, hello world is just print "hello world!"" "I don't know man, dynamic typing? White space?", "Come on, join us, programming is fun again, it's a whole new world up here" "But how are you flying?" "I just typed import antigravity", "That's it?" "Well I also sampled everything in the medicine cabinet for comparison, but I think it's the Python".
This is the feeling you should have as you think about packages and modules and all the stuff that you can do, let's talk about the idioms about consuming all these amazing packages.
